16 OpenCV Functions to Start your Computer Vision journey (with Python code)


Computer vision is among the hottest fields in any industry right now. It is thriving thanks to the rapid advances in technology and research. But it can be a daunting space for newcomers. There are some common challenges data scientists face when transitioning into computer vision, including:

1-How do we clean image datasets? Images come in different shapes and sizes
2-The ever-present problem of acquiring data. Should we collect more images before building our computer vision model?
3-Is learning deep learning compulsory for building computer vision models? Can we not use machine learning techniques?
4-Can we build a computer vsiion model on our own machine? Not everyone has access to GPUs and TPUs!
